# Random Number Analysis

Script Description:

The "Random Number Analysis" script simulates the rolling of three dice with numbers ranging from 1 to 18 over a large number of runs. It then analyzes the results to determine the frequency of each rolled number. Additionally, it identifies the top three most frequently rolled numbers and lists any numbers that did not roll.

The script displays the progress of the simulation, updating every 100,000 runs. After completing the simulation and analysis, it saves the results to a text file named "simulation_results_YYYY-MM-DD.txt" using the current date.

Usage:

To use the script, simply call the main() function with the desired number of simulation runs. For example, main(10000000) will run the simulation for 10 million times.
